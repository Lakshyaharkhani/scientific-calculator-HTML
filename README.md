# Scientific Calculator (Web-Based)

## Project Description

This project is a web-based scientific calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing both basic arithmetic operations and advanced scientific calculations directly within your web browser.

## Key Features

* **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **Scientific Functions:**
    * Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, arcsin, arccos, arctan).
    * Logarithmic and exponential functions (log, ln, e^x, 10^x).
    * Power and root calculations (x^y, √x, x√y).
    * Factorial calculation.
    * Constants: Pi (π) and Euler's number (e).
    * Degree and Radian modes.
* **User Interface:**
    * Clean and intuitive layout.
    * Clear display for input and output.
    * Responsive design for various screen sizes.
* **Error Handling:**
    * Robust error handling to prevent crashes.
